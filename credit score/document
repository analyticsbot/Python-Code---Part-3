Some questions I've

_________________________________________________________________________________

Step 1: Pre Bureau Check		
		
1. How long the bureau score will remain valid at our end? 30/60/90 days?
2. All this pre-score testing happens at the front end. Right?
3. Data points on the pre-check?
	1. name
	2. age
	3. something like an SSN -- we cant ask too much data. So something like SSN can give a whole lot of data.

Step 2: Post Bureau Check		
		
1. what data points we have on each user?
2. veda as mentioned in the file is a really good indicator of credit history, but what we can do is
	first ask the user for some basic data, if using that we cannot make a decision we go to veda. This is just to keep pricing in check.

Step 3: Servicability		
		
two major score that has to be calculated
	1. ICR 
	2. DSR

	can u explain in brief the significance of these scores.

Step 4: Valuation	
		
run the model to get the score and send response to the user whether application is approved or not


Data Sources
1. veda - how do we get data from them. I was looking for data that we can source from them, but couldnt find anything credible on the internet. Any examples?


Model

There are 3 types of credit models 
1. question or rule based model - something what we are currently doing. needs a lot of manually prepared question. not scablable plus the user will get bored. but highly accurate.
2. stats based model - mostly logistic or tree based models such as random forrest regression/classification is used. needs historical data to run. the model needs to be updated and checked at regular intervals. 

		1. logistic
		2. random forrest-  
		can be converted to rules easily

		quick, simple logic
		which can be converted into rules and credit policies, non parametric and can deal with
		interactions. The down side of trees is that they unstable, small changes in data can lead
		to large deviations in models, and can overfit if not built using cross validation and
		pruning. 
3. hybrid model - what we are using currently. mixes both of them. for the initial screening, a small number of QA is the best way, in the post-score, we can go for stats based.


example-- let's visualize a small company that has come for the loan to buy cattle. here are some random figures that are made up.

1. one way is of weighing different variables such as credit score, so for example
Variable
1 Loan to Collateral Value
>70% <70%
0 1
2 Annual Turnover to Loan Value
<3x >3x
0 1
3 Years in Business
<1 >1
0 1
4 Current Ratio
< 0.5 > 0.5
0 1
5 Total Assets (EUR)
<100K > 100K
0 1

this is pretty simple. we assign boolean values to the fields. so the end result will be a score.

Another scenario would be
Variable
1 Loan to Collateral Value
>70% <70%
0 3
2 Annual Turnover to Loan Value
<3x >3x
0 2
3 Years in Business
<1 >1
0 1
4 Current Ratio
< 0.5 > 0.5
0 1
5 Total Assets (EUR)
<100K > 100K
0 1

we can play with the weights. we can also add more buckets according to our need.

Statistical Scores
Creating statistical scorecards requires extensive data on past borrowers in the same
segment that will be scored. In our case, there is no data, particularly on problematic, or “bad”, clients.
need to think of ways how we can bypass this. maybe in starting we do manually and then side by side we train the model and check its accuracy.
we need good and bad clients.

Question --- how do we define bad users?
The definition of the segments of scoring: identifying the type of customers and products for which the scoring model will be used

Two types of data we require:

For socio-economic characteristics of the borrower, the variables that I can think of as of now are as follows:
• The age of the borrower
• Sex (gender)
• The number of dependents
• The number of loans already obtained
• The reimbursement of past loans
• The number of years spent practicing the current activity, lets say job or business. to see stable income

The variables for the characteristics of the loan are as follows:
• The purpose of the loan
• The guarantee provided
• The frequency of repayment required from the client's side and whether s/he can manage that
• The loan amount
• The duration of the loan


    # 1 - age (numeric)
    # 2 - job : type of job (categorical: "admin.","unknown","unemployed","management","housemaid","entrepreneur",
    #                        "student","blue-collar","self-employed","retired","technician","services")
    # 3 - marital : marital status (categorical: "married","divorced","single";
    #                               note: "divorced" means divorced or widowed)
    # 4 - education (categorical: "unknown","secondary","primary","tertiary")
    # 5 - default: has credit in default? (binary: "yes","no")
    # 6 - balance: average yearly balance, in euros (numeric)
    # 7 - housing: has housing loan? (binary: "yes","no")
    # 8 - loan: has personal loan? (binary: "yes","no")
