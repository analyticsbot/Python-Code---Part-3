We are taught to treat the entire world as a family, how can we remain insensitive to the continuing farmers tragedy in our own state? Can you turn a blind eye to the sufferings of our farmers, who are the "annadatta"? This is the time to show sympathy to our "annadatta". A standard cricket/football oval requires a minimum of 80,000 - 100,000 litres of water per application. Approximately 2 - 3 applications are required per week (160,000 - 300,000 litres per week) to maintain turf growth and repair damaged areas. More water is needed in hot windy conditions and less in cooler conditions. IPL season starts in Mumbai from April 09, 2016 with the finals in Mumbai on May 29, 2016. A total of 19 matches will be played in the Maharashtra i.e. Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur. Thus in the 19 Matches to be played in Maharashtra about around more than 70 lakh litres of water will be used to maintain the cricket grounds. When our state is affected by drought will it be wise to waste 70 lakh litres of water? It is true that the state will earn some revenue out of these matches but it cannot be at the cost of sufferings of our farmers. Our Chief Minister of Mahrashtra, Mr. Devendra Fadnavis " has launched the project "Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyaan" in a bid to make Maharashtra a drought-free state by 2019. The similar letter has been written by Shri Vivekanand Gupta, Secretary BJP, Mumbai to The President, BCCI. Even Mumbai faces acute water shortage, hence an appeal was made for a "waterless holi" and Mumbaikars positively responded. I hope you will support and sympathize with our farmers and sign this petition to shift the venue of IPL to other states.
