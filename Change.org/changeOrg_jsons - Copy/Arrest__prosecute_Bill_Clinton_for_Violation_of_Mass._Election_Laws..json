It could not be any clearer in the Massachusetts General Laws. "Campaigning within 150 feet of a polling station, or in any way interfering with the right to vote". Choosing the critical battleground state of Massachusetts, Bill Clinton should immediately be subject to arrest and prosecution. Bill Clinton was not only electioneering within the boundary. Although the spokesperson for Bill Clinton denies that he was ever inside a polling place, photos and video show him clearly greeting and talking up election workers inside.nAfter being told to refrain from this activity, which is a 3rd degree Voter Violation Felony, for which Clinton indeed must have known the law and chose to violate it, Bill Clinton does not vote in Massachusetts, and would have no other business in a polling station on election day besides campaigning for his wife.nWe, the undersigned, respectfully ask that you honor the democratic process with all the dignity it deserves, and hold Bill Clinton accountable for the felony of his actions.nThank you.nThere is also a whitehouse.gov petition that would be presented to President O\\\'Bama, should we be able to reach 100,000 signatures.
