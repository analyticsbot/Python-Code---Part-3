Further, we will not return to the Republican Party but will go about the task of consolidating Trump\'s political gains and reform the corrupt political system that cares more about itself than the interest of the United States. Karl Rove and company, never ones to lack hubris, are very mistaken if they think that humpty dumpty (the Republican Party) can be put back together.
