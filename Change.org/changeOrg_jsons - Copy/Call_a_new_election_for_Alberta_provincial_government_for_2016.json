Kasich, Mitt Romney and the Republican Party power brokers steal the Republican nomination from Donald Trump at the convention -- when Trump is the clear leader -- we will walk out of the Republican party and not support its nominee. Trump\'s support transcends his personality and is a movement that if the Republican Party was open, would welcome and leverage to the country\'s advantage, instead of impeding, obstructing and destroying. Further, we will not return to the Republican Party but will go about the task of consolidating Trump\'s political gains and reform the corrupt political system that cares more about itself than the interest of the United States. Karl Rove and company, never ones to lack hubris, are very mistaken if they think that humpty dumpty (the Republican Party) can be put back together.
