Leticia and her family were fortunate to live in a service area where the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires a company to offer affordable Internet but not everyone is so lucky. This fall, the FCC will be considering expanding pivotal programming for affordable internet access for America\\\'s families.nFamilies should not have to choose between food and medicine or the Internet. Sign on now to leave the FCC a public comment that asks them to provide affordable internet access to low-income families.","targeting_description":"Federal Communications Commission","letter_body":"We urge you to enact a Broadband Lifeline Program so that all low-income families and households can afford Internet service at home to harness the power of technology to help them escape concentrated and persistent poverty.  nnThe 5 recommendations below will do this because they address the 3 primary barriers to broadband adoption:  (1) Cost; (2) Relevance; and (3) Digital Literacy.nn- Require all Internet providers to offer an affordable high-speed Internet unbundled service with a wi-fi router in the range of $10/month.n- Establish a streamlined national process for third-party verification of eligibility.n- Capitalize an independent fund with proportionately-fair contributions from Internet providers to award performance-based grants to non-profit community organizations, schools and libraries (as the "trusted messengers") for outreach, digital literacy training and assistance in signing up low-income customers.n- Authorize and encourage states to implement their own statewide broadband lifeline initiative to complement and augment the FCC program.n- Focus on results with specific numeric goals for broadband adoption that are monitored by an oversight advisory council.nnIt is wiser to invest a little today than to condemn another generation to being stuck on the wrong side of the Digital Divide without 21st Century tools to tackle the wall of poverty and become self-sufficient.  nnPlease support these recommendations to give everyone a fair chance at America\\\'s opportunities.","end_date":"2016-09-14","goal":null,"relevant_location":{"city":"Washington","country_code":"US","lat":null,"lng":null,"state_code":"DC","google_places_id":null,"photo_id":null},"restricted_location":null,"slug":"the-homework-gap-is-real","status":"published","victory_date":null,"victory_description":"","is_verified_victory":false,"is_victory":false,"video":null,"is_pledge":false,"topic":"economicjustice","tags":[{"id":47969,"locale":"en-US","name":"utilities","slug":"utilities-en-us","total_count":null,"photo_id":null,"discoverable":null,"created_by_staff_member":true},{"id":7560,"locale":"en-US","name":"education","slug":"education-en-us","total_count":null,"photo_id":null,"discoverable":null,"created_by_staff_member":true},{"id":7437,"locale":"en-US","name":"economic justice","slug":"economic-justice-10","total_count":null,"photo_id":null,"discoverable":null,"created_by_staff_member":true},{"id":7778,"locale":"en-US","name":"technology","slug":"technology-9","total_count":null,"photo_id":139992263,"discoverable":null,"created_by_staff_member":true}],"discoverable":true,"total_signature_count":69348,"weekly_signature_count":1,"photo":{"id":90449860,"url":"photos/3/bq/fy/atbQfyXrBSienXq-fullsize.jpg","sizes":{"square":{"url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/3/bq/fy/atbQfyXrBSienXq-400x400-noPad.jpg?1442350137","processing":false,"size":{"width":400,"height":400}},"small":{"url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/3/bq/fy/atbQfyXrBSienXq-400x225-noPad.jpg?1442350137","processing":false,"size":{"width":400,"height":225}},"medium":{"url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/3/bq/fy/atbQfyXrBSienXq-800x450-noPad.jpg?1442350137","processing":false,"size":{"width":800,"height":450}},"large":{"url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/3/bq/fy/atbQfyXrBSienXq-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1442350137","processing":false,"size":{"width":1600,"height":900}}},"type":"photo"},"user":{"id":103329805,"slug":"103329805","first_name":"Jessica","last_name":"Schwartz","short_display_name":"Jessica","display_name":"Jessica Schwartz","city":"Redwood City","state_code":"CA","country_code":"US","website":"","locale":"en-US","description":"","photo":{"id":21041665,"url":"photos/7/ok/jz/UpoKJzjoAwxKoUB-fullsize.jpg","sizes":{"small":{"url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/7/ok/jz/UpoKJzjoAwxKoUB-48x48-noPad.jpg?1423780527","processing":false,"size":{"width":48,"height":48}},"medium":{"url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/7/ok/jz/UpoKJzjoAwxKoUB-128x128-noPad.jpg?1423780529","processing":false,"size":{"width":128,"height":128}},"large":{"url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/7/ok/jz/UpoKJzjoAwxKoUB-400x400-noPad.jpg?1423780532","processing":false,"size":{"width":400,"height":400}},"xlarge":{"url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/7/ok/jz/UpoKJzjoAwxKoUB-800x800-noPad.jpg?1453772743","processing":false,"size":{"width":800,"height":800}}}}},"organization":{"id":998481,"slug":"internet_for_all_now","name":"Internet for All Now","website":"http://www.internetforallnow.org/","country_code":"US","mission":"Internet for All Now is a campaign of the California Emerging Technology Fund (CETF) and partners.

to reduce motion blur on HDTVs but a very unfortunate side effect of using this function is that is takes something shot at 24 fps or shot on film and makes it look like it was shot on video at 60i. In short, it takes the cinematic look out of any image and makes it look like soap opera shot on a cheap video camera. It is unbelievable that this is a default setting on all HDTVs because essentially what it is doing, is taking the artistic intention away from filmmakers. As artists, these new HDTVs are preventing our vision from being seen the way we shot it and it\'s also affecting the viewer\'s experience with the story because they are often put off by the odd "home video" look. It\'s actually very distracting watching a classic like "Five Easy Pieces" and having it look like a sitcom shot on video. Any filmmaker or film buff should be aware of this and help stop it from being a default setting. At this stage, the majority of the world are not seeing the films and tv shows as they were intended by the creators. It\'s fair to have smooth motion as one of the options in the picture settings on HDTVs, because it actually is a great way to watch sports. But for literally everything else on tv, it cheapens the look and makes it look as if it\'s a soap opera. If you care about the artistic integrity of the visuals that you watch and appreciate cinematography and a cinematic experience, then you should sign this petition. And if you don\'t care about visuals and you only care about story, you should still sign this petition because the visuals are there to set the mood for you to get into the story. As a consumer, you should know that this function is ruining the theatrical experience that you are supposedly paying for when you purchase these expensive HDTVs. Don\'t you want to see the films and tv shows as the filmmakers intended you to see them- how beautiful and rich they look in the movie theater? If you are going to spend most of your time at home watching movies on your television, don\'t you want it to be as much of a theatrical experience as possible? A further irony is also that some of the manufacturers of these HDTVs (Sony and Panasonic) also manufacture the high end digital cameras that shoot in 24fps to give a more cinematic "film" look and they are the very same people negating that artistic choice. For a more in depth explanation on motion interpolation, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_interpolation. For all the technological advances we have made in our industry, it\'s as if we\'re taking a million huge steps backwards in terms of the look of the image by allowing motion interpolation to be a default setting. The Ideal: Manufacturers working together with broadcasters to create a way for the signal to automatically switch on "smooth motion" when sports are on tv. And the signal would switch OFF smooth motion for everything else, allowing everything to look it\'s best on tv. Smooth motion is also known as auto motion, motion boost, HD natural motion, digital clearmotion, TruMotion, smooth 120 Hz, Intelligent frame creation, etc. HERE IS A LINK TO ASSIST IN TURNING OFF THE MOTION INTERPOLATION ON YOUR TV: http://lifehacker.com/disable-motion-smoothing-to-get-rid-of-soap-opera-effe-1526424116', 'date': u'', 'external_id': u'changeorg_The-Homework-Gap-is-REAL'}
