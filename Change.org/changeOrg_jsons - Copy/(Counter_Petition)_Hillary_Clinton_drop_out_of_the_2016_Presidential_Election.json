With your support for progressive concerns, we would appreciate that you support Bernie now to help so WE can make the changes that we need. We know that you have been in line with a lot of the concerns of Democrats and you have pointed out MANY times that do feel strongly about the issues Bernie stands for. By dropping out now rather than later you would be doing the right thing for the country and the world.nHillary, you can be proud of the energy you created but the democratic voters need you to do the right thing by ending the 2016 Democratic Primary and to start immediately encouraging your supporters to UNITE with the focus on supporting Bernie in the general election to defeat Donald Trump.n***This is a counter petition in response to one made by the Hillary camp asking Bernie to drop out. ***","targeting_description":"Hillary Clinton","letter_body":"Hillary Clinton drop out of the 2016 Presidential Election","end_date":"2017-03-02","goal":null,"relevant_location":{"city":null,"country_code":"US","lat":null,"lng":null,"state_code":null,"google_places_id":null,"photo_id":null},"restricted_location":null,"slug":"hillary-clinton-hillary-clinton-drop-out-of-the-2016-presidential-election","status":"published","victory_date":null,"victory_description":null,"is_verified_victory":false,"is_victory":false,"video":null,"is_pledge":false,"topic":null,"tags":[{"id":6531,"locale":"en-US","name":"hillary clinton","slug":"hillary-clinton-en-us","total_count":null,"photo_id":null,"discoverable":null,"created_by_staff_member":false},{"id":25294,"locale":"en-US","name":"bernie sanders","slug":"bernie-sanders-en-us","total_count":null,"photo_id":null,"discoverable":null,"created_by_staff_member":false},{"id":26094,"locale":"en-US","name":"presidential election","slug":"presidential-election-en-us","total_count":null,"photo_id":null,"discoverable":null,"created_by_staff_member":false},{"id":32286,"locale":"en-US","name":"presidential race 2016","slug":"presidential-race-2016-en-us","total_count":null,"photo_id":null,"discoverable":null,"created_by_staff_member":false},{"id":7779,"locale":"en-US","name":"politics","slug":"politics-9","total_count":null,"photo_id":null,"discoverable":null,"created_by_staff_member":true},{"id":25706,"locale":"en-US","name":"donald trump","slug":"donald-trump-en-us","total_count":null,"photo_id":null,"discoverable":null,"created_by_staff_member":true}],"discoverable":true,"total_signature_count":49286,"weekly_signature_count":576,"photo":{"id":124911590,"url":"photos/9/gp/tb/TiGpTBPoiUZhCXD-fullsize.jpg","sizes":{"square":{"url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/9/gp/tb/TiGpTBPoiUZhCXD-400x400-noPad.jpg?1456987655","processing":false,"size":{"width":400,"height":400}},"small":{"url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/9/gp/tb/TiGpTBPoiUZhCXD-400x225-noPad.jpg?1456987655","processing":false,"size":{"width":400,"height":225}},"medium":{"url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/9/gp/tb/TiGpTBPoiUZhCXD-800x450-noPad.jpg?1456987655","processing":false,"size":{"width":800,"height":450}},"large":{"url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/9/gp/tb/TiGpTBPoiUZhCXD-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1456987655","processing":false,"size":{"width":1600,"height":900}}},"type":"photo"},"user":{"id":433112130,"slug":"433112130","first_name":"Brandi","last_name":"Seely","short_display_name":"Brandi","display_name":"Brandi Seely","city":"Greenfield","state_code":"OH","country_code":"US","website":"","locale":"en-US","description":"","photo":{"id":125073098,"url":"photos/3/jy/sg/LuJySGiccqweqHZ-fullsize.jpg","sizes":{"small":{"url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/3/jy/sg/LuJySGiccqweqHZ-48x48-noPad.jpg?1456972445","processing":false,"size":{"width":48,"height":48}},"medium":{"url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/3/jy/sg/LuJySGiccqweqHZ-128x128-noPad.jpg?1456972445","processing":false,"size":{"width":128,"height":128}},"large":{"url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/3/jy/sg/LuJySGiccqweqHZ-400x400-noPad.jpg?1456972446","processing":false,"size":{"width":400,"height":400}},"xlarge":{"url":"//d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/3/jy/sg/LuJySGiccqweqHZ-800x800-noPad.jpg?1456972446","processing":false,"size":{"width":800,"height":800}}}}},"targets":[{"id":714904,"display_name":"Hillary Clinton","email":null,"type":"Custom","slug":"hillary-clinton","description":"Hillary Clinton is a former United States Secretary of State, U.S. Senator, and First Lady of the United States.

Further, we will not return to the Republican Party but will go about the task of consolidating Trump\'s political gains and reform the corrupt political system that cares more about itself than the interest of the United States.
