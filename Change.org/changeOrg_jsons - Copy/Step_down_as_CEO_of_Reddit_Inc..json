Steve Huffman, Co-founder of reddit has returned as a permanent CEO. In the past week, this petition has gained over 200,000 supporters. That is an incredible amount of people who came together sharing the same concern and opinion of how reddit was being managed. It was quite sad to see how sick and savage people acted towards Ellen Pao, but there were also a lot of people who respectfully gave their opinion and constructive criticism about the whole situation. Today, I am declaring this petition a victory! Below is an official announcement posted to reddit by /u/samaltman (Sam Altman, President of Y Combinator).nnEllen Pao resigned from reddit today by mutual agreement. I\\\'m delighted to announce that Steve Huffman, founder and the original reddit CEO, is returning as CEO.nnWe are thankful for Ellen\\\'s many contributions to reddit and the technology industry generally. She brought focus to chaos, recruited a world-class team of executives, and drove growth. She brought a face to reddit that changed perceptions, and is a pioneer for women in the tech industry. She will remain as an advisor to the board through the end of 2015. I look forward to seeing the great things she does beyond that.nnWe\\\'re very happy to have Steve back. Product and community are the two legs of reddit, and the board was very focused on finding a candidate who excels at both (truthfully, community is harder), which Steve does. He has the added bonus of being a founder with ten years of reddit history in his head. Steve is rejoining Alexis, who will work alongside Steve with the new title of "cofounder".nnA few other points. Mods, you are what makes reddit great. The reddit team, now with Steve, wants to do more for you. You deserve better moderation tools and better communication from the admins.nnSecond, redditors, you deserve clarity about what the content policy of reddit is going to be. The team will create guidelines to both preserve the integrity of reddit and to maintain reddit as the place where the most open and honest conversations with the entire world can happen.nThird, as a redditor, I\\\'m particularly happy that Steve is so passionate about mobile. I\\\'m very excited to use reddit more on my phone.nnAs a closing note, it was sickening to see some of the things redditors wrote about Ellen. [1] The reduction in compassion that happens when we\\\'re all behind computer screens is not good for the world. People are still people even if there is Internet between you.nnIf the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion, it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community. Steve\\\'s great challenge as CEO [2] will be continuing the work Ellen started to drive this forward.nn[1] Disagreements are fine. Death threats are not, are not covered under free speech, and will continue to get offending users banned.nEllen asked me to point out that the sweeping majority of redditors didn\\\'t do this, and many were incredibly supportive. Although the incredible power of the Internet is the amplification of voices, unfortunately sometimes those voices are hateful.nn[2] We were planning to run a CEO search here and talked about how Steve (who we assumed was unavailable) was the benchmark candidate--he has exactly the combination of talent and vision we were looking for. To our delight, it turned out our hypothetical benchmark candidate is the one actually taking the job.","kind":"news_coverage","embedded_media":{},"created_at":"2015-07-11T02:39:58Z","photo_id":null,"video":null,"petition":{"id":3562547,"document_id":"3562547","ask":"Step down as CEO of Reddit Inc.","created_at":"2015-06-11T01:25:47Z","original_locale":"en-US","languages":["en"],"title":"Ellen K.

Yesterday a new policy was implemented on Reddit and was put into action immediately. Many subscribers of the banned subreddits and others became enraged.

The new changes and new policies are in no doubt censorship which panders to a vocal minority.nnFree speech rationale: nnIn accordance with the site\\\'s policies on free speech, Reddit does not ban communities solely for featuring controversial content. Reddit\\\'s general manager Erik Martin noted that "having to stomach occasional troll reddits like /r/picsofdeadkids or morally questionable reddits like /r/jailbait are part of the price of free speech on a site like this," and that it is not Reddit\\\'s place to censor its users. The site\\\'s former CEO, Yishan Wong, has stated that distasteful subreddits won\\\'t be banned because Reddit as a platform should serve the ideals of free speech.

In short, it takes the cinematic look out of any image and makes it look like soap opera shot on a cheap video camera. It is unbelievable that this is a default setting on all HDTVs because essentially what it is doing, is taking the artistic intention away from filmmakers. As artists, these new HDTVs are preventing our vision from being seen the way we shot it and it\'s also affecting the viewer\'s experience with the story because they are often put off by the odd "home video" look. It\'s actually very distracting watching a classic like "Five Easy Pieces" and having it look like a sitcom shot on video. Any filmmaker or film buff should be aware of this and help stop it from being a default setting. At this stage, the majority of the world are not seeing the films and tv shows as they were intended by the creators. It\'s fair to have smooth motion as one of the options in the picture settings on HDTVs, because it actually is a great way to watch sports. But for literally everything else on tv, it cheapens the look and makes it look as if it\'s a soap opera. If you care about the artistic integrity of the visuals that you watch and appreciate cinematography and a cinematic experience, then you should sign this petition. And if you don\'t care about visuals and you only care about story, you should still sign this petition because the visuals are there to set the mood for you to get into the story. As a consumer, you should know that this function is ruining the theatrical experience that you are supposedly paying for when you purchase these expensive HDTVs. Don\'t you want to see the films and tv shows as the filmmakers intended you to see them- how beautiful and rich they look in the movie theater? If you are going to spend most of your time at home watching movies on your television, don\'t you want it to be as much of a theatrical experience as possible? A further irony is also that some of the manufacturers of these HDTVs (Sony and Panasonic) also manufacture the high end digital cameras that shoot in 24fps to give a more cinematic "film" look and they are the very same people negating that artistic choice. For a more in depth explanation on motion interpolation, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_interpolation. For all the technological advances we have made in our industry, it\'s as if we\'re taking a million huge steps backwards in terms of the look of the image by allowing motion interpolation to be a default setting. The Ideal: Manufacturers working together with broadcasters to create a way for the signal to automatically switch on "smooth motion" when sports are on tv. And the signal would switch OFF smooth motion for everything else, allowing everything to look it\'s best on tv. Smooth motion is also known as auto motion, motion boost, HD natural motion, digital clearmotion, TruMotion, smooth 120 Hz, Intelligent frame creation, etc. HERE IS A LINK TO ASSIST IN TURNING OFF THE MOTION INTERPOLATION ON YOUR TV: http://lifehacker.com/disable-motion-smoothing-to-get-rid-of-soap-opera-effe-1526424116', 'date': u'', 'external_id': u'changeorg_Step-down-as-CEO-of-Reddit-Inc.'}
