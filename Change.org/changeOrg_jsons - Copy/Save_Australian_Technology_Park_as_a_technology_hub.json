It is home to 100 resident technology firms providing over 5,500 jobs and research positions. It is also part of the local community - providing local jobs, support for community programs and high-quality campus services. ATP has been an integral part of the Australian technology industry. It is a hub for technology collaboration that is sorely needed in Australia.Why we care about the fate of ATPThe fate of ATP is that it may be closed and sold to property developers. It would be either be turned into a business park or as apartment blocks. nThere are many of us who have worked hard to build Sydney and Australia as an innovative country. We believe that for Australia to progress as a nation we need to invest in technology companies and the use of technology. We have to transition away from our current export mix which is primarily producing raw materials. As we fall behind other countries in the innovation race, we will only experience a greater drain of our brightest minds and technology companies as they go overseas.

It is home to 100 resident technology firms providing over 5,500 jobs and research positions. It is also part of the local community - providing local jobs, support for community programs and high-quality campus services. ATP has been an integral part of the Australian technology industry. It is a hub for technology collaboration that is sorely needed in Australia.Why we care about the fate of ATPThe fate of ATP is that it may be closed and sold to property developers. It would be either be turned into a business park or as apartment blocks. nThere are many of us who have worked hard to build Sydney and Australia as an innovative country. We believe that for Australia to progress as a nation we need to invest in technology companies and the use of technology. We have to transition away from our current export mix which is primarily producing raw materials. As we fall behind other countries in the innovation race, we will only experience a greater drain of our brightest minds and technology companies as they go overseas. We will become less competitive on a global level."There is symbolic power in having some sort of physical location in Sydney like New York has Roosevelt Island or London has Shoreditch, as a physical manifestation of the city\\\'s commitment to the technology industry," Mr Cannon-Brookes of Atlassian said. "What we\\\'re saying to government is that a physical place is one plank in a broader set of initiatives they need to put together if they\\\'re really committed to changing this stuff."HistoryIn 1991, the creation of Australian Technology Park was announced. This was a bold initiative from Sydney\\\'s leading universities to regenerate and re-use the largely vacant site as a technology and innovation hub. By 2000, management of the park had transferred to the NSW Government and transformation into a technology park was well underway. Today, the site has 100 companies, predominantly in the technology industry.Atlassian bid to save ATP as a technology hubAtlassian, one of Australia\\\'s leading technology companies is lobbying to keep the ATP as a technology hub. The NSW Government is preparing to sell the land to property developers. Atlassian has put in a joint bid with a property development company to be the anchor tenant. They also have commitments from other technology firms to relocate to ATP.nWhat you can doLets create a groundswell of support from the Australian startup community.

We believe that for Australia to progress as a nation we need to invest in technology companies and the use of technology.

One is from Tom Forgan, the founding CEO of ATP. The second is from Stan Jeffrey, the founding director of ATP Innovations. nnI was also contacted by John Glastonbury, one of the founding ATP members & former Dean of Engineering at University of Sydney. He supported the petition and wanted to maintain the technology & innovation focus of the park. nnn1. ATP FOUNDING CEO\\\'s SUPPORTnn"As the founder of the ATP I gave ten years of my life to create this world class Technology Park and I am at a loss to understand how this world recognised Technology Park can be dismantled when it was the envy of numerous countries around the world. nnWith the Prime Minister repeatedly speaking about the need for top research as a financial driver for our country, it makes no sense whatsoever to close or water it down. Please feel free to contact me as I have a vast amount of information relating to this project. Tom Forgan"nnn2. FOUNDING DIRECTOR OF ATP INCUBATOR SUPPORTnn"I was the founding director of the ATP incubator and technology programnnThe ATP has proved itself as a world class centre with many prizes and awards to it and its companies. Also many groups include many delegations from china in there inaugural phase of world wide technology parks program gaining insight and ideas about the structure.nnThe ATP has been a success and used derelict and polluted land to the benefit of Sydney and Australia.nnThe proposal to sell this asset and the difficulty with the covenants and land remediation set by the government has resulted in the current technology park model not being financially viablennI did look at the possibility of a consortium that I would be part of purchasing the ATP however the restrictions and incumbencies made the proposal unpalatable.nnOne way forward would be for the Government to look at what would be the best way to package and sell the asset and make it useful as a technology asset and not a real estate development.nnI clearly can see now the Silicon Harbour development has been announced that the government has a broader idea. This I would expect to take many years and the ATP initiative would be lost.nnIn a city the size of Sydney with three universities near by the Silicon harbour and the ATP Maybe they could become part of the innovation corridor from Ryde to the airport. This would use the asset and benefits already developed and paid for by the people of NSW.nnIf you would like I am prepared to assist in this planning and development". nn- Stan Jeffrey, founding director of ATP Incubatornnn3. MET WITH ATP REPSnnI met with representatives of ATP who wanted to inform me about the sale process and to give me a tour of the property. I met with them to hear their point of view. They would like to add additional buildings. They have asked the government for funding and were not able to secure funding for the development. The land has to be sold off as one parcel. From next year, ATP also needs to start paying rent. I have been informed that a sale is required for the necessary funds to develop the land.nnn4. ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION ON SYDNEY TECH STARTUP POLICYnnYesterday, I attended a roundtable discussion on The City Of Sydney Tech Startup Action Plan organised by the Labor party. In attendance were the Shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, Shadow Parliamentary Secretary Ed Husic, Councillor Linda Scott & Director of Local Government NSW.nnI brought up the issue of density of startups and the need to keep ATP as a technology focus. They acknowledged the importance of ATP as a technology hub and have had discussions with Liberal party about this.nnI also wrote a blog post about the roundtable summarising what was discussed and my personal views on "Sydney Startup Ecosystem Needs Money And Knowledge To Thrive". nnhttp://inspiredworlds.com/sydney-startup-ecosystem-needs-money-and-knowledge/nnLets see if the roundtable discussions leads to anything.nnn5. AFR ARTICLE "ATLASSIAN: ATP NOT JUST REAL ESTATE".nnThere was in the article in the AFR yesterday about ATP. You can view it here:nnhttp://inspiredworlds.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_2130-e1446839152636.jpgnnThanks to Sharon Lu, GM at Tyro FinTechHub for spotting it. nnn6. VISIT TO ATPnnI visited ATP a few weeks ago. I was in the ATP Innovations building for a meeting. I happened to bump into a startup investor, Rayn Ong that I knew who was there for a board meeting for a startup he had invested in. Later on, another startup founder, Brent Clark from WattBlock who I recognised walked down the stairs. Brent gave me a tour of the building. On the tour, I met 7 startup founders and their employees from the Muru-d and StartMate accelerator programs. I also visited ATP incubator and saw the great work being done there by innovative companies.nnI left the building to meet with ATP reps. I decided to come back one last time to walk through the building. I wanted to see if I could serendipitously bump into another person. At the couch downstairs, I met Vicky Lay, a startup founder that had recently become a Venture Capitalist at Artesian. nnI met at least 10 people I had not planned to meet in my short visit involved in technology & innovation industry. Being there creates opportunities for collaboration and knowledge exchange. nnn7. ATP PHOTOSnnI took some photos of the ATP complex for those that have not been there recently. I have posted these on my blog here:nnhttp://inspiredworlds.com/australian-technology-park-photos/n nnPlease continue to share the petition on social media and email your friends & contacts that care about the future of technology and innovation in Australia.nnCheers, nMatthew HonSydney Startups","kind":"news_coverage","embedded_media":{"description":"Today I attended the Tech Startup Action Plan Roundtable organised by the Labor party at Sydney Town Hall.

to reduce motion blur on HDTVs but a very unfortunate side effect of using this function is that is takes something shot at 24 fps or shot on film and makes it look like it was shot on video at 60i. In short, it takes the cinematic look out of any image and makes it look like soap opera shot on a cheap video camera. It is unbelievable that this is a default setting on all HDTVs because essentially what it is doing, is taking the artistic intention away from filmmakers. As artists, these new HDTVs are preventing our vision from being seen the way we shot it and it\'s also affecting the viewer\'s experience with the story because they are often put off by the odd "home video" look. It\'s actually very distracting watching a classic like "Five Easy Pieces" and having it look like a sitcom shot on video. Any filmmaker or film buff should be aware of this and help stop it from being a default setting. At this stage, the majority of the world are not seeing the films and tv shows as they were intended by the creators. It\'s fair to have smooth motion as one of the options in the picture settings on HDTVs, because it actually is a great way to watch sports. But for literally everything else on tv, it cheapens the look and makes it look as if it\'s a soap opera. If you care about the artistic integrity of the visuals that you watch and appreciate cinematography and a cinematic experience, then you should sign this petition. And if you don\'t care about visuals and you only care about story, you should still sign this petition because the visuals are there to set the mood for you to get into the story. As a consumer, you should know that this function is ruining the theatrical experience that you are supposedly paying for when you purchase these expensive HDTVs. Don\'t you want to see the films and tv shows as the filmmakers intended you to see them- how beautiful and rich they look in the movie theater? If you are going to spend most of your time at home watching movies on your television, don\'t you want it to be as much of a theatrical experience as possible? A further irony is also that some of the manufacturers of these HDTVs (Sony and Panasonic) also manufacture the high end digital cameras that shoot in 24fps to give a more cinematic "film" look and they are the very same people negating that artistic choice. For a more in depth explanation on motion interpolation, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_interpolation. For all the technological advances we have made in our industry, it\'s as if we\'re taking a million huge steps backwards in terms of the look of the image by allowing motion interpolation to be a default setting. The Ideal: Manufacturers working together with broadcasters to create a way for the signal to automatically switch on "smooth motion" when sports are on tv. And the signal would switch OFF smooth motion for everything else, allowing everything to look it\'s best on tv. Smooth motion is also known as auto motion, motion boost, HD natural motion, digital clearmotion, TruMotion, smooth 120 Hz, Intelligent frame creation, etc. HERE IS A LINK TO ASSIST IN TURNING OFF THE MOTION INTERPOLATION ON YOUR TV: http://lifehacker.com/disable-motion-smoothing-to-get-rid-of-soap-opera-effe-1526424116', 'date': u'', 'external_id': u'changeorg_Save-Australian-Technology-Park-as-a-technology-hub'}
